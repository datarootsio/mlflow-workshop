# Demo Code for MLflow Workshop

MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and tracking.

## Using the Demo Code

The main part of this tutorial is written in Jupyter notebooks and can be found in the `notebooks` folder:

- `getting-started.ipynb` - Introduction to MLflow
- `train-your-first-model.ipynb` - Experiment tracking with MLflow
- `train-your-first-model-with-signature.ipynb` - Add model signature to your runs
- `model-inference.ipynb` - Try the model you just put in production
- `the-iris-exercise.ipynb` - First exercise to get familiarity with MLflow
- `heart-disease-prediction.ipynb` - Intro notebook to understand MLflow projects
- `mnist-exercise.ipynb` - Simple exercise to start develop an MLflow project
- `register-your-model.ipynb` - Use this notebook to get familiarity with the MLflow API

Inside the `src-mlflow-project` you will find an example of an MLflow Project

## Dependencies
Just create a venv and pip install the `requirements.txt` file

## Have fun
